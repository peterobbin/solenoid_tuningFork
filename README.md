# Mic Controlled Solenoid
## Description
This an experimental sound installation project by Haotian Li and Luobin Wang. 

Our everyday behavior slightly affects the environment around us. The amount is so tiny that we would not be able to notice the little changes. By turning our attachment to the space inside out, the intertwined connection becomes more sensitive and obvious. 

A box represents our inner space, a room represents the environment. Every interaction on the tiny box will be reflected by those tuning forks on the wall - constant, responsive hitting of solenoids deliver vibrations to the chamber amplifier. 

This nested structure questions the true connection between spaces, are we really have the control of ourselves? By presenting this experience, we would like to see what the relation between spiritual and physical presence could possible be.
